*"Do you know that you exist? If he so much hears the question there can be no doubt about the answer."*


### What can we learn from St. Augustine?

#### Reason
The first good thing about Augustine is that he was *not* a skeptic, i.e., he defended the possibility of *knowledge*. But what surprised me was that he did not do it solely on logical grounds but on moral ones. What does that mean? For Augustine, "happiness" seems to be the goal, and since the skeptic by his own construction is someone who searches without any possibility of discovery, he cannot be happy. In fact, we would say that he is rather silly. In other words, the skeptic sets himself up for inevitable failure since his tool of survival (reason) leads nowhere. 


Now there is a sligth interesting connection to Descartes here. St. Augustine said that "If I err, I am" which is oddly similar to cogito ergo sum. I caught myself almost accepting this sentence but realised that the proper causal chain is "I am, therefore I err," but I still believe this was an effective antidote to the "Academic argument" in his time. Further, to distinguish Augustine from Descartes, we know the latter made "doubt" his primary truth which all other truths were derived from, whereas for Augustine there are other base premises which other truths depend on. 


#### Free Will
"Hands too many may be misused but nobody complained that God gave man hands;"

#### Faith
What is Faith according to Augustine? *Faith is the acceptance of a proposition as true on the testimony of witnesses.*
