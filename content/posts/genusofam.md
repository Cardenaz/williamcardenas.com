> What is the genus of angular momentum? 

We want a definition on the form of: 

> Angular momentum is a X with the differentia Y. 

But it is not self-evident to me what exactly it should be. 

We know that it is a physical quantity, but this might be too wide of a category. 

> Suggestion 1: Angular momentum is a physical quantity that describes rotational motion. 

This can't be proper since, e.g., define $L = r \times v$, and that would also describe rotational motion but not be angular momentum. So the definition is missing an inertial quantity.
